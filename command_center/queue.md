## Ready (after A–D)
1. Connect local repo to GitHub remote.
2. Configure Cloudflare Pages (build command + output dir + branch deploy).
3. Implement niche micro-tool page and client-side JS logic.
4. Draft 3 money pages with disclosure block above first affiliate link.
5. Draft 5 support pages.
6. Run gates: citations, QA/compliance, duplication, Astro build/link checks.

## On Hold
- Any outbound affiliate links until affiliate parameters are provided.
- Any deployment until GitHub + Cloudflare settings are complete.
