Use these as tailored drafts (not copy-paste spam). Personalize with your real context before posting.

## 1) Indie Hackers (Product/Marketing)
**Angle:** Free practical checklist + interactive picker for small teams.
**Draft:**
Built a free vendor-evaluation checklist + 3 interactive stack pickers for sales/outbound/support teams. No email gate, no paid data, just practical “what to verify before you buy” workflows. If you’ve bought a tool too early and regretted it, would love feedback on what we missed.

- Pickers: /tools/*
**Snippet:** "Free stack evaluation checklist + picker tools for lean teams (no signup). Feedback welcome."

## 2) Hacker News (Show HN)
**Angle:** Lightweight decision-support tools with downloadable templates.
**Draft:**
Show HN: I made tiny decision tools for selecting sales call intelligence, outbound, and support stacks, plus a downloadable checklist template for live demos. Goal was to reduce overbuying by mapping constraints first.
Would appreciate critiques on decision criteria quality.
**Snippet:** "Show HN: constraint-based stack picker tools + downloadable vendor checklist."

## 3) Reddit r/salesops
**Angle:** Demo-call checklist to avoid poor-fit tooling.
**Draft:**
Sharing a free checklist we now use in vendor demos to avoid buying tools that break at implementation. Covers CRM sync, workflow overhead, reporting, migration risk, and support SLAs. Also includes a simple call-intelligence picker for smaller teams.
If useful, I can post a version tuned for Salesforce-heavy orgs.
**Snippet:** "SalesOps checklist: 8 questions to ask before choosing call intelligence vendors."

## 4) Reddit r/revops
**Angle:** Routing and ownership handoff risk controls.
**Draft:**
Put together a vendor evaluation checklist for RevOps teams focused on handoff risk: routing logic maintainability, reporting depth, migration/exit safety, and admin overhead. Free download (CSV/MD) + matching outbound stack picker.
Curious what additional “must ask in demo” items you require.
**Snippet:** "RevOps demo checklist + outbound stack picker for routing-heavy teams."

## 5) Reddit r/customer_success
**Angle:** Support stack maturity path (lean → growth).
**Draft:**
For CS/support leaders: free support-stack picker and checklist for demo calls. We’ve been using this to separate “good in trial” vs “maintainable in production.” Focus areas: SLA handling, escalation workflows, tagging governance, and onboarding support.
Would value real-world additions.
**Snippet:** "Support stack picker + procurement checklist for CS teams (free, no gate)."

## 6) GrowthHackers
**Angle:** CTR-focused funnel architecture (tool → money page routing).
**Draft:**
We rebuilt our affiliate funnel around “support article/tool first, money page second.” Added contextual CTA routing and a free downloadable checklist asset for linkability. Early goal is higher tool-to-comparison clickthrough, not raw traffic spikes.
Sharing if anyone wants the content flow model.
**Snippet:** "Tool-first affiliate funnel: support/tool → comparison routing + free linkable asset."

## 7) BetaList / startup directories profile update
**Angle:** Resource utility, not pitch.
**Draft:**
Micro Affiliate Factory is a free library of practical buyer resources: stack pickers, comparison pages, and downloadable vendor evaluation templates for sales, outbound, and support teams.
Primary value: faster shortlisting with fewer implementation surprises.
**Snippet:** "Free stack pickers + downloadable vendor checklist templates."

## 8) Affilorama / affiliate forums
**Angle:** Compliance-first affiliate content ops.
**Draft:**
We’re testing a compliance-first affiliate system: disclosures above monetized links, no guaranteed-results claims, and support-first educational pages that route to comparison content. Added a downloadable checklist page as a linkable asset for organic distribution.
Open to critique on balancing monetization and trust.
**Snippet:** "Compliance-first affiliate model: disclosure placement + support-first routing."

## 9) LinkedIn post (founder/operator audience)
**Angle:** Overbuying prevention framework.
**Draft:**
Most teams don’t buy the wrong tool—they buy too early, with vague evaluation criteria.
We published a free vendor-evaluation checklist (CSV/Markdown) plus interactive stack pickers for call intelligence, outbound, and support workflows.
Use it in demos to pressure-test fit before procurement.
**Snippet:** "Free vendor evaluation checklist + stack pickers to reduce tool overbuying."

## 10) X/Twitter thread
**Angle:** 5-question pre-demo filter + resource link.
**Draft:**
If you’re evaluating sales/outbound/support tools this quarter, ask these before any demo:
1) What breaks first at your current team size?
2) Who maintains rules after launch?
3) Can you export everything if needed?
4) What’s your SLA/escalation risk?
5) What must be true by week 6 to keep the tool?
