# Cluster #2 Research Shortlist (Hybrid niches)

## Candidates
1. Dental practice imaging workflow software + operatory/capture accessories
2. Security installer operations SaaS + camera/network hardware bundles
3. Creator streaming operations SaaS + production gear
4. Gym retention/access automation SaaS + kiosk/access hardware
5. MedSpa consultation-to-conversion SaaS + clinic AV/accessory hardware

## Top Pick from research agent
**MedSpa consultation-to-conversion stack** (strong LTV, clear buyer intent, hybrid monetization fit), with compliance caution due to medical-adjacent context.

## Decision for current roadmap
To reduce risk and keep non-YMYL posture, we are implementing cluster #2 in a safer B2B workflow domain:
**Outbound deliverability + appointment scheduling stack** (non-medical, lower compliance risk).
