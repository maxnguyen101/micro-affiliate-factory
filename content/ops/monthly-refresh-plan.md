# Monthly Refresh Plan

## Goal
Keep rankings and conversion quality stable by refreshing facts, links, and decision sections every month.

## Monthly checklist
1. Run `npm run gates`.
2. Review top money pages and tools for stale claims.
3. Update source links and add a `What changed` note.
4. Re-check disclosure placement.
5. Rebuild + deploy.

## What changed format
- Date
- Page(s)
- What was updated (comparison criteria, integrations, links, copy clarity)
- Why (accuracy / conversion / compliance)
